								<h2>Marlène Neto</h2>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/marlene.jpg" alt="" /></span>Born on November 28th 1992 in France, she moved during her childhood to Portugal’s countryside (let’s just say that what got her through it was all the fun adventures she had with her little sister) where she lived until she was 17 yo, when she was accepted in the Fashion Design Bachelor in Universidade da Beira Interior, near one of the only mountain areas where it snows in Portugal. At this stage she made some of her best friends for life, the ones that went through thick and thin. The ones that went through all sort of adventures. Although fashion and design were some of Marlène’s passion’s, she felt like pursuing another one related to creative writing.</p>
									<p>This is how she ended up doing a master’s in Strategical Communications, Advertising and PR, doing a semester abroad in Valencia, Spain. In Valencia she found herself and fell in love with small things in life like writing in her journal in the park, daydreaming of moving to other countries with her friends, catching sunsets through her camera, and learning how to ride a bike at 2am on a Thursday (this one turned out useful for the next destination).</p>
									<p>After Valencia, was time for Marlène to keep exploring the world so she moved to Amsterdam for an internship. The memories she made there were unbelievable and shaped her into an independent and adventurous woman. After all the going around, it was time to finally return to Portugal and finish that damn master’s thesis. And so she did.</p>
									<p>In 2017 she moved to Lisbon and met Luis. From 2017 until 2021 she pretty much only worked in marketing and digital agencies and it was nice for all the great friends she made along the way, it was challenging and creative at times, but never fulfilling enough. Something was always missing. So, right in middle of the pandemic she decided to open her own business and create art full-time. And that is how @da.wildside was born. A couple of exhibitions, a lot of art markets and sales later, her goals for da.wildside are to do solo exhibitions in Portugal and worldwide and to empower people, especially women and people who don’t feel represented in art and media, to be an ally to the LGBTQI+ community, and a feminist activist through her art.</p>

									<h3>Our Story</h3>
									<p>On December 7th 2017 the cold in Lisbon was unbearable and Marlène & Luis met for the first time. Their chemistry was undeniable from the start, they talked for hours on the first date and laughed for hours on the second date. They went on dates all around the city, and when the city got too small for their love, they decided to move in together after only 2 months of being in a relationship, back in August 2018.</p>
									<p>Needless to say that everything was working out perfectly, even though everyone warned them they were rushing things out. On February 2019 they did their first big trip together to India, to a friend’s wedding, ending up traveling from Bangalore to Goa and finally staying in Mumbai. This trip brought them closer together as it was during Valentine’s day where they spent the day lost in they middle of nowhere in Goa’s countryside and a lot of adventures happened that day until they made it to the 12h overnight bus to Mumbai. After this amazing trip together, traveling together ended up being a ritual for them.</p>
									<p>In November 2019 they also visited Amsterdam and Copenhagen where they visited friends and created a bunch of new, unforgettable memories.</p>
									<p>Then, the pandemic hit and no more traveling was possible. In fact, they were stuck in this tiny apartment for the whole work-from-home & stay-at-home dynamic. Did they went insane for a moment there? Absolutely. Did they thought about living under the stairs of the building so they didn’t have to be together all the freaking damn time in that tiny apartment? Of course. But did they managed to find a way to work it out and still love each other more and more everyday? Yeah, you got me, they did that too.</p>
									<p>So 2021 hit and they were finally planning a new trip again. This time to Spain: Valencia and Barcelona, where both of them studied years ago and created so many beloved memories. Some friends joined them in what would become a life changing holiday. The trip begin in Valencia where Marlène almost lost a tooth, got the flu and a handful of feet blisters. Taking antibiotics on a trip with your boyfriend and friends is not the ideal when all you want is to have some fun, but no fun happened for Marlène. At least not on the first part of this trip. On the other hand, Luis was acting all nervous and cranky. Was it because Marlène was sick and kinda ruining everyone’s vacation’s mood? Let’s not jump into conclusions. The gang said goodbye to Valencia after a series of unfortunate events and arrived to Barcelona. Marlène was feeling worse, Luis was feeling crankier. Their friends decided to go their own way and meet at the end of the day on the 8th day of vacation. Luis and Marlène were alone, fighting because he wanted her to enjoy the city that meant so much to him, but she was sick, burning with fever. He seemed nervous. What was going on? Marlène felt better for a short period of time, they made up and decided to go all the way up to Castell de Montjuic. It was so nice, you had an amazing view over the whole city. They decided to take a picture together. So Marlène posed while Luis set the photo timer and suddenly he ran over to her, got on his knee and asked her to marry him. And snap! The camera took a picture of that moment. She didn’t say no ahah. She said yes. And all the pain went away. For like an hour, then she had to take her antibiotics again.</p>
									<p>And here we are, ready to go on this adventure of celebrating our wedding with all of you. Are you in? :)</p>
